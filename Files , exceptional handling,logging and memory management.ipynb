What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages ?\n","\n"," ▶ The main difference between interpreted and compiled language lies in how they execute code. Compiled languages translate the entire program into machine code before execution, while interpreted languages execute the code line by line as it's being run.\n","\n","2. What is exceptional handling in python ?\n","\n"," ▶ Exception handling in python is a mechanism to gracefully manage errors that occurs during the execution of a program. It prevents the program from crashing by catching and responding to these errors.\n","\n","3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling ?\n","\n"," ▶ The finally block in python's exception handling mechanism is used to define a section of code that will always execute, regardless of whether an exception occurred in the try block or not. It is primarily used for cleanup actions and releasing resources that must be performed no matter what.\n","\n","4. What is logging in python ?\n","\n"," ▶ Logging in python is a built-in module that provide a flexible framework for emitting log messages from python programms. It allows developers to track events that occur while the software runs. These events are described by a descriptve messages which can optionally contain variable data.\n","\n","5. what is significance of the __del__ method in python ?\n","\n"," ▶ The __del__ method in python is a special method, often reffered to as a destructor. It is automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed. This usually occurs when an object's reference count drops to zero, indicating that it's no longer in use and is eligible for garbage collection.\n","\n","6.

Why is memory management important in Python ?\n","\n"," ▶ Memory management is crucial in python for several reasons:-\n","\n"," 1. Efficient resource utilization:- Memory management ensures that python programs use memory effectively by allocating space for new objects and reclaiming memory when objects are no longer needed.This prevents memory wastages and allows programms to run smoothly without exhausting available resources.\n","\n"," 2. Automatic memory handling:- python employs automatic memory management, freeing developers from manually allocating and delocatting memory,unlike languages like C and C++.This simplifies development and reduces the risk of memory leaks.\n","\n"," 3. Garbage collection:- Python's garbage collector automatically identfies and reclaims unused memory.This process prevents memory from being occupied by objects that are no longer referenced, ensuring efficient memory usage.\n","\n"," 4. Performance optimization:- Efficient memory management directly impacts program performance. By managing memory effectively, Python programs can avoid slowdowns and run faster, especially when handling large datasets or complex operations.\n","\n"," 5. Stability and realiability:- Proper memory management helps prevent program crashes and errors caused by memory-related issues. By ensuring that memory is handled correctly.Python programs become more stable and reliable.\n","\n","14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling ?\n","\n"," ▶ In exception handling, try and except blocks work together to gracefully manage errors. The try block contains code that might potentially raise an exception, While the except block catches and handles these exceptions,preventing the program frm crashing.\n","\n","15. How does Python's garbage collection system work ?\n","\n"," ▶ Python uses a hybrid garbage collection system combining refernce counting and generational garbage collection t manage memory effectively. Reference counting tracks how many variables point to an object, and when it reaches zero, the object is ddellocated.However, reference countng doesn't handle circular references(where objects point to each other ),which is where generational garbage collection comes in. It identifies and removes objects that are no longer reachable,breaking cycles.\n","\n","16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling ?\n","\n"," ▶ The 'else' block is executed when there are no exceptions raised within the try block. The 'else' block is useful when you want to perform specific actions when no exceptions occur. It can be used, for example, to execute additional code if the 'try' block suceeds in its operation and enhances the program flow.\n","\n","17. What are the common logging levels in Python ?\n","\n"," ▶ Here are the common login levels in python\n","  \n","  1. DEBUG(10)\n","  2. INFO(20)\n","  3. WARNING(30)\n","  4. ERROR(40)\n","  5. CRITICAL(50)\n","  6. NOTSET(0)\n","\n","18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python ?\n","\n"," ▶ os.fork()\n","\n","  1. low level system call:- os.fork() is a direct interface to the operating system's fork system call. It creates a new process that is an exact copy of calling process.\n","\n","  2. copy on write:- It uses copy-on-write mechanism, which means that child process intially shares the parent's memory. Changes made by either process are only copied when necessary.\n","\n","  3. Unix-like systems:- os.fork() is pramarily available on unix-like systems(linux,macOS).It's not supported on windows.\n","\n","  4. Potential issues:- When used with multithread programs , os.fork() can lead to issues like deadlocks because only the calling thread is duplicated in the child process.Locks held by other threads in the parent process won't be released in the child process.\n","\n","  5. Memory usage:- Forking lead to increased memory usage if both parent and child processes start modiying the shared memory, causing it to be copied.\n","\n","  ▶ Multiprocessing module:-\n","\n","  1. High level abstration:The multiprocessing module provides a higher-level interface for creating and managing processes.\n","\n","  2. cross-platform: It works on both unix-like systems and windows.\n","\n","  3. process manangement: It provides tools for inter-process communication(IPC),such as queues and pipe, which allow processes to exchange data.\n","\n","  4. Better for multithread programs: Multiprocessing is generally safer to use with multithread programs, especially when using the spawn start method.\n","\n","  5. More robust: It handles process creation and management more robustly than using os.fork() directly.\n","\n","19.  What is the importance of closing a file in Python ?\n","\n"," ▶ When a file is open, the operating system allocates memory and other resources to the file,which can potentially impact the performance of the system if too  many files are open at the same time. By closing the file, you release these resources back to the system, which can be used by other processes or programs.\n","\n","20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python ?\n","\n"," ▶ file.read() reads the entire content of a file and returns it as a single string while file.readline() reads a single line from the file,including the newline character(\\n) at the end of the line if it exists.\n","\n"," ▶ file.read() can consume a lot of memory if the file is large, as it loads the entire content into memory at once while file.readline() is more memory efficient for large files as it reads one line at a time.\n","\n","21.  What is the logging module in Python used for ?\n","\n"," ▶ The logging module in python is a standard library feature used for tracking events,debugging issues and monitoring the health of applications. It provides a flexible way to record inforamtion about errors, warnings and other events that occur during program execution.\n","\n","22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling ?\n","\n"," ▶ Python has a built-in os module with methods for interacting with the operating system, like creating files and directories, management of files and directories, input , output, environment variables,process management etc.\n","\n","23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python ?\n","\n"," ▶ Challenges with Python memory management:\n","\n","  1. Unpredictable Usage: Automatic management (reference counting, garbage collection) makes precise memory control difficult and can cause performance pauses during garbage collection cycles.\n","  2. Memory Leaks: Despite automatic GC, leaks can occur due to:\n","   * Circular references: Objects referencing each other prevent deallocation.\n","  * Unreleased external resources: Forgetting to close file handles, network connections, etc.\n","  * Long-lived objects/globals: Objects held indefinitely can accumulate memory.\n","   3. GIL & Concurrency: The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limits true parallelism in multi-threaded Python, impacting memory-intensive parallel tasks.\n","  4. Debugging Difficulty: Pinpointing memory leaks or inefficiencies can be challenging due to Python's abstraction of memory internals.\n","  5. Large Data Efficiency: In-memory processing of large datasets can lead to high memory usage and \"out of memory\" errors, exacerbated by object overhead and immutable type operations creating new objects.\n","\n","24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python ?\n","\n"," ▶ In python, exceptions can be raised manually using the raise keyword. this allows developers to trigger specific errors based on conditions or logic within code\n","\n"," basic syntax:-"],"metadata":{"id":"0JVQIqg87qTq"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["raise ExceptionType(\"Error message\")"],"metadata":{"id":"F8DkWUCP8ka9"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["25.  Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications ?\n","\n"," ▶ Multithreading is crucial for applications needing to perform multiple tasks simultaneouslyor to improve responsiveness and resource utlization.
